              <p>The main objective of this project was to design a user interactive game on using the programming language, Scratch. For this project I was given instructions on how to proceed and what to include. In this project my partner and I split up the work evenly. I coded and developed levels 1 and 3, while my partner worked on the home page and level 2. One main challenge I faced was adding elements to level 3 that increase in difficulty. Level 3 was the most challenging level of our game, which meant it had more going on compared to the other elements. In order to code this, I had to add multiple costumes and variables to ensure the timing is right. In this project we created an escape room simulation game. In every level you had a set amount of time to use the clues and escape the room. Each level increases in difficulty as the game moved along. Throughout the project my partner and I recorded everything our documentation to keep track of our project. At the end though, my partner and I scored well because we met the requirements on the rubric. Throughout this project, I learned about certain features we can add to scratch and how sprites can communicate with each other on the platform. I also learned how to keep track of my documentation throughout the project. </p>
