            <p>A business’ webpage is a magnet, pulling clients to a company. The very first impression your company has on any client is the home page of their website. I have always been interested in the business world, and exploring the role technology plays in the success of a business. When I grow up I want to be a business woman. A business woman is a female executive that leads the company and helps them grow their profits and business. Based on the way our world and technologies are growing right now, the future is going to be heavily technology based. I want to learn the basics of programming and engineering in high school, so that I can apply them later on and help my company grow.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A business woman needs three main skills: ambition, diligence, and confidence. Business woman are often the face of the company and need to have the strength to take risks to help the company grow to the next level.Last  year, I was the Vice-President of my school’s CJSF Chapter. I organized The Hunger Games Canned Food Drive, and helped my school raise 6,000 pounds of canned food (the second highest in the county). This drive took place right before Thanksgiving Break, and for the first week we were getting very limited donations. But I changed the format of the drive, made it a school wide competition and got a record breaking amount of donations. From all these experiences I have learned that when I put my mind to something, I end up doing it. I set a goal for myself on how many pounds of food I want to raise, and I exceeded it after a lot of hard-work. As a member of my school’s debate team I have won constant awards. Last year, I won The Golden Gavel Debate Award: This award is given to the top speaker at every tournament. Debating has taught me time-management, and public speaking. I am not scared to share my ideas in a crowd. Nor am I scared to take on a leadership position. In my Freshman year of high school I was invited to join The Dublin Mayor’s Council, and Dublin’s Youth Advisory Council. As a committee member in both I have worked on projects to improve the daily lives of Dublin teens. To further strengthen my skills I decided to take a programming class in my first year of high school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In September 2019, I was offered a paid internship with Bay Area Bhangra Empire. My task was simple; I had to assist with choreography and teaching for the Dublin and Fremont weekly classes. This experience helped me learn how to express my ideas. Often times we have an idea in our mind but do not know how to explain it to others. Teaching gave me the chance to learn how to explain complicated moves to students, who have not learned them before. I became more confident in my self, and learned how to work productively to come up with new ideas for routines. All this will help me lead my own company someday in the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Becoming a businesswoman isn’t an overnight job, but with hard work, perseverance, and poise it can eventually become a reality. I know that my past experiences and skills show that I have what it takes to be successful in the business world. Thank your time and patience, and I wish the best of luck as you explore the rest of this site!</p>
